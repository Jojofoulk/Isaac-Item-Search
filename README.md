#Isaac Item Search üîç

This tool was made for me to search for an Item's name in The Binding of Isaac based on its colour.Right now it adds a list of items in json file, and stores the most common colours for each items.

This repo is mostly for archiving, but I might have fun and revisit it if I feel like it. I started this project way before learning about a mod that tells you everything about an item while playing! <b>(Check out the mod on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836319872))</b>

##How to use
<sub>*why would you use it?*</sub>

run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run python on `main.py` and that's pretty much it
